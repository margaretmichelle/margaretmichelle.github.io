                    <h4>Overview:</h4>POLARIS is a fully autonomous sailboat designed by students to collect data in the Pacific Ocean. 
                        I led the design and manufacturing of the hull, keel, and cradle, managing a group of 10 engineering students across 
                        different disciplines. We used Maxsurf to analyze and optimize hydrostatic and hydrodynamic properties, and SolidWorks 
                        and ANSYS to characterize her structure and select appropriate materials. In Fall 2024, we completed the manufacturing 
                        of her hull, involving large-scale carbon fibre layups over a wood core. After months of finishing touches and copious 
                        integration with the sail, rudder, and electrical teams to ensure she can sail by herself, POLARIS is nearing her 
                        maiden launch this summer. Learn more about POLARIS <a href="https://www.ubcsailbot.org/projects/#polaris">here</a>.

                    <h4>Maxsurf</h4>
                    <p>
                        We designed our hull using Maxsurf Naval Architecture Software (Modeler, Stability, and Resistance). The shape was loosely 
                        inspired by Saildrone's USVs, heavily modified to fit our size and manufacturing requirements, and optimized to work with the 
                        rest of the sailboat system. The displacement was designed to hold all of our components (sail, rudder, keel, electronics, etc.) 
                        as well as the weight of the hull itself while floating with our set waterline. The length, shape, and waterline were iterated 
                        to obtain a resistance that works with the lift generated by our rigid wingsail at our design speed. The righting moment, dictated 
                        by the shape of the hull and its waterline, and moment balance were analyzed to design a suitable bulb keel. Further, the hull 
                        was adjusted to improve manufacturability. All these properties were unmistakably related and required an iterative design cycle, 
                        clear design constraints and criteria, and careful trade-off analysis.

                    <h4>Ansys</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our next step was determining the material and internal structure known as bulkheads to strengthen and partition the hull. One 
                        of my members and I used Ansys Static Structural to examine the stresses and deformation resulting from loads, including
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hydrostatic forces</li>
                            <li>Hydrodynamic forces</li>
                            <li>Lift, drag, and weight from the sail</li>
                            <li>Lift, drag, and weight from the rudder</li>
                            <li>Lift, drag, and weight from the keel</li>
                        </ul>
                        We used Ansys Composite PrepPost (ACP) to model our composite sandwich panels, settling on a marine-grade plywood core for the hull 
                        and a PVC foam core for the deck after a WDM analysis to balance weight, cost, and strength among other criteria. A carbon fibre 
                        skin was chosen due to availability and experience, as our last two vessels utilized carbon fibre.

                    <h4>SolidWorks</h4>
                    <p>
                        The hull was transferred into SolidWorks where we finished the design, added sensors, hatches, electrical enclosures, and integrated 
                        with the sail and rudder assemblies. The keel was designed in SolidWorks based on our previously determined parameters while creating 
                        the hull. We use proper naming convention and version control tables to keep track of all the contributions from our many members, 
                        a system I created and implemented. We are currently still working on finalizing all integration details as well as desiging a cradle 
                        for land transportation and launch of the sailboat with SolidWorks.

                    <h3 id="manu">Manufacturing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Over two months during our winter school term, we manufactured our hull and bulkheads and began to build the keel. I organized sessions 
                        of up to 20 members performing large carbon fibre hand layups with subsequent vacuum bagging, wood cutting and assembly, and fairing 
                        sessions to level and smooth the exterior surface of the vessel, just to name a few of our tasks. Though many lessons were learned, 
                        the manufacturing sprint was a great success. The hull has since been faired and painted, the rudder and sail have been integrated, 
                        and cable gland holes and electrical enclosure mounts have been added. The keel fin was made using a CNC milling machine and underwent 
                        a similar fairing and painting process as the hull.

                    <p>
                        Integration with other teams has been crucial to make this project a success, requiring constant discussion 
                        with the sail and rudder teams to ensure our designs were always compatible. We also did extensive integration 
                        with the electrical team, with a balance of modifying the hull design (e.g. maximizing possible solar panel space 
                        on the deck, balancing electrical components to maintain stability) and setting requirements for them (e.g. the 
                        maximum number and size of wiring holes through each bulkhead for structural strength, battery enclosure size).
