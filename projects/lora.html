                    <h4>Overview:</h4> <p>Over 1 million pets in Canada go missing each year, with over 80% of those who 
                        are unchipped never being found. As someone who grew up with dogs, this is a heartbreaking 
                        statistic. While technology exists to track our beloved pets, it's far from perfect, being too 
                        costly, passive, or short-range. As my group's senior capstone project, we decided to address these 
                        shortcomings and design and build our own pet tracking solution using LoRa. LoRa modulation is a technique 
                        used to encode information on radio waves for long-range applications; it's free to use, energy 
                        efficient, and highly robust to noise. We designed a compact, LiPo-powered PCB and collar that provides live 
                        tracking updates to a custom mobile app. The PCB integrates LoRa, GPS, and IMU modules along with 
                        a custom antenna to provide real-time, responsive monitoring of your pet.

                    <p>We split this project up into three components: hardware and firmware, mobile app and database, antenna 
                        and mechanical design. With one person each focusing on the latter two, my teammate and I tackled the 
                        hardware and firmware coponents. We began prototyping with a SAMD21 Pro RF chip that has both a SAMD21 
                        and RFM95W, an Adafruit PA1010D GPS module, and a STM32 LSM6DSOX IMU. Using Arduino to program, we experimented 
                        with the parameters of LoRa modulation, range, and noise immunity. We developed different modes of operation: 
                        normal, search, and sleep. The user-intitiated search mode sends GPS updates more frequently and transmits 
                        stronger signals using higher power for when you need to actively search for your pet. The sleep mode is 
                        dependent on the IMU readings; if your pet is stationary (e.g. when they're sleeping), the collar will 
                        save energy and will not update the position until your pet moves again. We also implemented acknowledgment 
                        handshakes and random backoff to ensure reliable connection and handle network collisions between the collar 
                        and base station. Lastly, we tested the energy consumption of the components to select a LiPo battery that 
                        would sustain the device operating in search mdoe (the most demanding mode) for multiple days before needing 
                        to be charged.

                    <figcaption>Simplified system diagram</figcaption>
                    <p>For our PCB, we upgraded our components, replacing the SAMD21 Pro RF with a LoRa-E5 that integrates a STM32WLE5JC 
                        and a LoRa module into a small package, and switched out our GPS for an Antenova M20071. We ported our previous 
                        work in Arduino to the STM32 environment and wrote libraries for our GPS, IMU, and LoRa that built upon the STM32WLxx 
                        drivers for the STM32WLE5JC to communicate with and command our modules over I2C and UART. I did most of the firmware 
                        and assisted my teammate in designing the PCB in Altium, where I mainly focused on power connections and charging 
                        of the device.

                    <p>Though we experienced issues integrating our collar PCB with our base station that still used the SAMD21 due 
                        to a mismatch of LoRa parameters between the two systems, this project was a great learning experience and I 
                        hope to continue working on it as a side project in the future. We were able to achieve a range of 1km in a 
                        suburban environment with our prototype and had a beautiful app and full functionality within the loop between 
                        the app, the server, the base station, and the collar. We were honoured to be awarded the Roy Nodwell Memorial 
                        Prize given to a project that exhibits high professional standard, shows evidence of original contribution, 
                        and has industrial relevance.
