                    <p>POLARIS is a fully autonomous sailboat designed by students to collect data in the Pacific Ocean. 
                        I lead the design and manufacturing of the hull, keel, and cradle. We used Maxsurf to analyze 
                        and optimize hydrostatic and hydrodymanic properties, and SolidWorks and ANSYS to characterize her structure and 
                        select appropriate materials. In Fall 2024, we completed the manufacturing of her hull involving large-scale 
                        carbon fibre layups over a wood core. Learn more about POLARIS <a href="https://www.ubcsailbot.org/projects/#polaris">here</a>.

        <h3>Maxsurf</h3>
        <p>
            We designed our hull using Maxsurf Naval Architecture Software (Modeler, Stability, and Resistance). The shape was loosely 
            inspired by Saildrone's USVs, heavily modified to fit our size and manufacturing requirements, and optimized to work with the 
            rest of the sailboat system. The displacement was designed to hold all of our components (sail, rudder, keel, electronics, etc.) 
            as well as the weight of the hull itself while floating with our set waterline. The length, shape, and waterline were iterated 
            to obtain a resistance that works with the lift generated by our rigid wingsail at our design speed. The righting moment, dictated 
            by the shape of the hull and its waterline, and moment balance was analyzed to design a suitable bulb keel. Further, the hull 
            was adjusted to improve manufacturability. All these properties are unmistakably related and required an iterative design cycle, 
            clear design constraints and criteria, and careful trade-off analysis.

        <h3>Ansys</h3>
        <p>
            Our next step was determining the material and internal structure known as bulkheads to strengthen and partition the hull. One 
            of my members and I used Ansys Static Structural to examine the stresses and deformation resulting from loads including
            <ul>
                <li>Hydrostatic forces</li>
                <li>Hydrodynamic forces</li>
                <li>Lift, drag, and weight from the sail</li>
                <li>Lift, drag, and weight from the rudder</li>
                <li>Lift, drag, and weight from the keel</li>
            </ul>
            We used Ansys Composite PrepPost (ACP) to model our composite sandwich panels, settling on a marine-grade plywood core for the hull 
            and a PVC foam core for the deck after a WDM analysis to balance weight, cost, and strength among other criteria. A carbon fibre 
            skin was chosen due to availability and experience as our last two vessels utilized carbon fibre.

            </figure>
        </div>
        <h3>SolidWorks</h3>
        <p>
            The hull was transferred into SolidWorks where we finished the design, added sensors, hatches, electrical enclosures, and integrated 
            with the sail and rudder assemblies. The keel was designed in SolidWorks based on our previously determined parameters while creating 
            the hull. We use proper naming convention and version control tables to keep track of all the contributions from our many members, 
            a system I created and implemented. We are currently still working on finalizing all intgration details as well as desiging a cradle 
            for land transportation and launch of the sailboat with SolidWorks.

        <h2 id="manu">Manufacturing</h2>
        <p>
          Over two months during our winter school term, we manufactured our hull and bulkheads, and began to build the keel (big shoutout to AMPEL 
          for letting us use their space). I organized sessions of up to 20 members performing large carbon fibre hand layups with subsequent vacuum 
          bagging, wood cutting and assembly, and fairing sessions to level and smooth the exterior surface of the vessel, just to name a few of 
          our tasks. Though many lessons were learned, the manufacturing sprint was a great success.
